# tkinterCalculator

Test project of a Calculator capable of performing simple as well as scientific calculations (function integrals and derivatives included) in Python.   

The goal was to learn independently (by doing) the usage of tkinter Python library for GUI, which is not taught on most Python courses, both college and online. 

The calculator is able to perform all basic operations as well as several scientific ones, including 

 > statistical operations
 > limits and factorials
 > trigonometrical functions, arcfunctions and hyperbolic functions
 > degree-to-radian and radian-to-degree conversions
 > derivatives and integrals

It also features:
 > e, Pi and infinite constans
 > two types of parenthesis [] and ()
 > four classical variables x,y,z and t.

The calculator will display the appropriate functions Maths, Sympy, Statistics and Matplotlib functions. 
For example, if you want to calculate the variable y partial derivative of the equation 9x+9y, you need to click on d/dx and write on the screen:

Then click the green Calculate button to get the answer (9)

In the case of integrals specifically, integrating a value (for example x) would result in x**2/2 (x^2)/2. 
This is useful for calculating simple definite and indefinite integrals, but consider that indefinite integrals require the "+c" addition constant to be scientifically correct.
